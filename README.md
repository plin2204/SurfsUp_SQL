# Surf-Up
•	Explain the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.<br />
•	Differentiate between SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.<br />
•	Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.<br />
•	Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.<br />
•	Design a Flask application using data.

# Challenge 8
•	Determine key statistical data about the month of June.<br />
•	Determine key statistical data about the month of December.<br />
•	Compare your findings between the month of June and December.<br />
1. The mean, max, and min temperatures in June all are higher than December. 
2. The std of June is lower than December, indicating values are also closer to the mean.<br />

•	Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
1. Besides temp, prcp should be looked into as well, since prcp is important (better not too much and not too less).
2. Other than june and dec, other monthes should be also included, so we could have other data to compare with.
